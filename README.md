# PlanetarySystem_HNN
**Hybrid method for solving the gravitational N-body problem with Artificial Neural Networks**

**Description**

The repository contains the code to generate a dataset of planetary system trajectories that is fed into the trianing of a Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) and a regular Deep Neural Network (DNN).
The trained networks are then used for the integration of those planetary systems.
